=========================

Enter an entire chemical formula. Example: Ca3(PO4)2. Parentheses are accepted, as long as there is a number after the parentheses.  Enter the number of moles of substance needed for your calculation. 

Click 'calculate'. A table will appear below, showing the grams and ounces per mole. On row two of the table, you will see the specific mass that you need. 

Below the calculations table, another table will show the elements in the formula by name, symbol, and mass.  

Feel free to leave comments or questions. Application still needs a little work in regards to error handling. It is still possible to pass in erroneous data.
